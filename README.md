I am a data scientist working for a retail company. The company is interested in under-
standing customer purchasing patterns to create targeted marketing strategies. My task

is to apply clustering techniques (KMeans and KMedoids) to segment customers based
on their purchasing data. You will evaluate the clustering quality using the Silhouette
score and provide insights into the identified clusters.
